# Spy++

This tool is written with VB 6 when I just started programming.  
Although there's less practical value, some techniques are worth a look, for example, both the way to make window transparent and the way to get command line of *any* process are less documented on the web.  

## STARTED
Just download `Spy++.exe` and run it.
